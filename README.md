# Obsidian AU  

This is the Obsidian "Golden Vault" template based on the West Virginia State Technology Conference 2022 presentation on "Note-taking in Obsidian", presented on behalf of West Virginia Network (WVNET), the host of the conference, by Gustavo Keener, a Banner DBA for WVNET.

For more details and usage notes, see [the Obsidian AU Vault on Github.com](https://github.com/v2keener/gAUldf).

## 20220509 Update

This project should house only the most basic of stuff I've put in the 'Public' project, which I referenced above. I call this project the "template" project, and it shouldn't be a project in the traditional sense of the word. It should be more like a short set of tasks to get this little Github repo to where it needs to be.
